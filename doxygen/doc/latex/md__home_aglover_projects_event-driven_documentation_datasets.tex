Event-\/driven datasets contain the stream of events captured from a single or stereo event cameras. Each dataset can be played using the {\itshape yarpdataplayer}. Once the dataset is loaded in the {\itshape yarpdataplayer} the specified output port (default=/zynq\+Grabber/v\+Bottle\+:o) is opened and can be connected to any event-\/driven processing module, the event-\/driven preprocessing module, or directly to the {\itshape v\+Framer}.

Each datasets may also contain, other sensors on the i\+Cub (also re-\/playable with the {\itshape yarpdataplayer}) and ground truth measurements, given the task (e.\+g. ball locations, corner locations). Also included are Matlab scripts to generate the result figures as in the relevant papers.

Datasets recorded with the D\+VS and A\+T\+IS have the following properties which must be set correctly, in the module parameters and the cmake options, to interpret the data\+: \begin{quote}
\mbox{[}D\+VS\mbox{]} width=128 height=128 V\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+10\+B\+I\+T\+C\+O\+D\+EC=O\+FF V\+L\+I\+B\+\_\+32\+B\+I\+T\+T\+I\+ME=O\+FF \end{quote}
