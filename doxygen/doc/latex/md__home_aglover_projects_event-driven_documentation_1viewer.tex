Visualise a stream of events from the cameras / from a pre-\/recorded sequence.

\subsection*{Description}

This application demonstrates how to visualise a stream of address events either from the cameras or from a pre-\/recorded sequence. The event stream is transmitted from the cameras (/zynq\+Grabber/v\+Bottle\+:o) to the v\+Pre\+Process (/v\+Pre\+Process/v\+Bottle\+:i), that removes salt-\/and-\/pepper noise from the event stream. The filtered stream (/v\+Pepper/v\+Bottle\+:o) is sent to v\+Framer (/v\+Framer/\+AE\+:i), that converts it to a yarpview-\/able image. The \char`\"{}images\char`\"{} from left (/v\+Framer/left) and right camera (/v\+Framer/right) are then sent to the yarp viewers (/view\+Ch0 and /view\+Ch1).

Here is a visualisation of the instantiated modules and connections.



\subsection*{Dependencies}

No special dependencies are required, all the required modules will be executed by the application.

\subsection*{How to run the application}

These are basic instructions for first time Y\+A\+RP users, assuming the comprehensive instructions have been followed.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item copy the application template into the yarpmanager search path, removing the .template extension
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
cp \$\+I\+C\+U\+Bcontrib\+\_\+\+D\+IR/share/\+I\+C\+U\+Bcontrib/templates/applications/app\+\_\+v\+View.xml.\+template $\sim$/.local/share/yarp/applications/app\+\_\+v\+View.\+xml \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item download a dataset from the datasets section of the \href{http://robotology.github.io/event-driven/doxygen/doc/html/pages.html}{\tt tutorials page} and unpack to a location of your choosing.
\item run a yarpserver
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
yarpserver \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item (in a seperate terminal) run a yarpdataplayer
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
yarpdataplayer \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item in the yarpdataplayer gui, open the downloaded datsets (File-\/$>$open) by pressing \char`\"{}\+Choose\char`\"{} on the upper-\/level folder (e.\+g. folder name\+: fasthandtrim)
\item the dataset should be open in the yarpdataplayer window with a \char`\"{}\+Port Name\char`\"{} of \char`\"{}/zynq\+Grabber/v\+Bottle\+:o\char`\"{}.
\item (in a separate terminal) run a yarpmanager
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
yarpmanager \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item the yarpmanager gui should be open.
\item on the entities tab (left) open the \char`\"{}\+Applications\char`\"{} folder -\/ the v\+View application should be visible. Double click the v\+View application to load it.
\item give the height and width of the camera used in the dataset (see the dataset specifications) to the v\+Framer by inserting in the Parameters section of the v\+Framer module in the yarpmodulemanager. For example\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
--height 128 --width 128 \end{quote}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item run all the modules in the v\+View app by choosing \char`\"{}\+Run All\char`\"{} in the left-\/most vertical toolbar. All applications should become green.
\item connect all yarp ports by choosing \char`\"{}\+Connect All\char`\"{} in the same toolbar. All connections should turn green.
\item press \char`\"{}\+Play\char`\"{} on the yarpdataplayer. The dataset should be visible in the yarpview windows (split into left and right cameras).
\item To close all applications first \char`\"{}\+Disconnect All\char`\"{} and then \char`\"{}\+Close All\char`\"{} on the left-\/hand toolbar. G\+UI\textquotesingle{}s are closed as per a normal window. The yarpserver can be closed using \char`\"{}ctrl+c\char`\"{} in the appropriate terminal.
